No Pants Day
------------

Met a girl, took my chance
Asked her out, went to a dance
Sad to say, difference in stance
She didn´t like me not wearing pants

I feel good, I feel okay
what I don´t need I throw away
I don´t care that she did not stay

I feel good, I feel okay
what I don´t need I throw away
I feel good, let it sway
Today is No Pants Day

Went to work, a nine-to-five
but my look slightly modified
My colleagues they wonder why
I wear Birthday Suit and tie

I feel good, I feel okay
what I don´t need I throw away
I don´t care what my boss will say

I feel good, I feel okay
what I don´t need I throw away
I feel good, let it sway
Today is No Pants Day

Sunday Church, well more or less
My mother says I am a mess
If there´s a god I must confess
I like to wear a sinful dress

I feel good, I feel okay
what I don´t need I throw away
I don´t care if there´s hell to pay

I feel good, I feel okay
what I don´t need I throw away
I feel good, let it sway
Today is No Pants Day
